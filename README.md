# Mini End-to-End Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my repository of mini end-to-end data analytics projects! In this repository, you'll find various projects where I use Python, MySQL, and the Kaggle API to perform data analysis and build analytical solutions.

Each project in this repository demonstrates how to gather, clean, analyze, and visualize data, while utilizing MySQL for database management and Python for data manipulation and analysis. The Kaggle API is used to download datasets directly from Kaggle for convenience and reproducibility.

These projects are for learning purposes on;y, they are inspired from  Ankit Bansal's Playlist on End-to-end Data Analytics.

2. **[Project 2: End to End ETL]**  
   - **Description**: Netflix Data Cleaning and Analysis Project (SQL + Python)
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, MySQL, Kaggle API
   - **Data Source**: Kaggle (provide a link to the dataset)
   - **Key Insights/Results**: - Handled duplicate values and created separate tables for genres, countries, and directors.
                               - Counted the number of movies and TV shows created by each director in separate columns.
                               -  Identified directors who have created both TV shows and movies.
                               - Found the country with the highest number of comedy movies.
                               - Analyzed the director with the maximum number of movies released in each year (based on the date added to Netflix).
                               - Calculated the average duration of movies in each genre.
                               - Listed directors who have created both horror and comedy movies, displaying the number of each type of movie directed.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **MySQL**: To manage, store, and query the data efficiently.
- **Kaggle API**: To download datasets from Kaggle directly and easily.
